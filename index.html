				<div class="textP">
				<p>At last one lifts one&rsquo;s head, and another dream disappears&mdash;where does it go? One reaches back for it in one&rsquo;s mind&mdash;and reactivates a thought, something else entirely, a glittering image. Something quivers inside it, an inertia, a gravity. What here is tickled? What motions have commenced? Something gathers, rises, cusps over the edge, surges &hellip;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>A family vacation. One is young&mdash;ten, eleven, perhaps. This trip, one&rsquo;s parents insist, a milky fondness in their eyes, is a gift, a freedom, a time to be enjoyed. To one, above all it is a time to be with one&rsquo;s eldest sibling, the idol of one&rsquo;s youth, who one looks up to with an unreasoned, unconsidered fervor, who one worships as a way themselves. What one&rsquo;s sibling desires enters the world as one&rsquo;s desires fluidly, as if there were no media nor mind traversed in the transference, as if it belonged to both at the moment of its conception &hellip; the cottage one&rsquo;s family rents is tucked into a sleepy hamlet near a beach whose refined white sand has blown into the turns and gutters and cracks of the streets&mdash;the whiteness pales the hanging, sinewy verdure, abundant but salted-thin, brittle and sand-choked. Copses and leaf-strewn paths branch off every chalky road&mdash;the decaying tunnels wend through properties whose demarcations the sands and the winds have long ago effaced &hellip; one&rsquo;s family had taken an isolated way that pathed through overgrown groves, gray-green, thick with thistle and lichen and loose-barked sea-birch, and opened onto a pristine, secluded beach. Here, the ocean, graded from the earthy hues, emerged a quiet infinity, eliciting, even then&mdash;for one was young&mdash;grand conceptions of oneself. Here&mdash;and even then&mdash;one howled with the fierce wind of identity; one hummed the quiet lullabies of thought&mdash;and so did one's sibling, first, irrevocably &hellip; one&rsquo;s sibling wishes to take one, one alone, to this beach&mdash;and so it is one&rsquo;s desire as well. One&rsquo;s parents worry, avoid the question. But one&rsquo;s sibling insists. At last, despite themselves, one parent concludes it&rsquo;s safe enough: the kids, they&rsquo;re older now, it&rsquo;s time they, their parents, realized that. The other parent looks on worryingly, knowing something and feeling another, saying nothing &hellip; and so it is allowed. With great fanfare one and one&rsquo;s sibling begin. As the property&rsquo;s threshold is crossed, something changes, something inside changes. Adults now, humans now, one and one&rsquo;s sibling begin to march&mdash;one&rsquo;s sibling knows the way to the path; of course, mature, one's sibling has memorized it, has observed the world, internalized its knowledge&mdash;one knows this. One follows willingly, gladly: alone, on a foreign road, walking with one&rsquo;s idol, conquering the world, becoming alive&mdash;could one ask for more? One doesn&rsquo;t think of what sunlight remains in the day, though it is late: an hour of walking flies by in sheer delight. There is nothing to fear, for one is following one&rsquo;s messiah to a promised land, a new existence &hellip; another hour passes. Night begins to descend. One&rsquo;s sibling, to one&rsquo;s shock, begins to cry. The hamlet is small, there are no road signs, the streets are all similar: another brown-paneled house dilapidating under the steady pressure of sea weather, another white shack greening at the gills&mdash;this at every corner. Paths to the beach suggest themselves&mdash;one copse beckons, another; one&rsquo;s sibling suggests one is near, though one&rsquo;s sibling is weeping. And then the confession&mdash;I do not know where we are anymore &hellip; the myth fractures. Suddenly one knows fear. One&rsquo;s mind leaps into the unknown: one is sure to die, one knows what it means to be alone and die; one loses one&rsquo;s name in the suffocating fear. There is no hope&mdash;for one&rsquo;s sibling cries too, a hopeless wail. An hour of tears &hellip; not a soul passes. The sand whips up and around, settles in the nostrils, hair, teeth. Night now. One and one&rsquo;s sibling must move. One chooses left because one has not chosen anything for hours&mdash;but the path is long foregone. One only wants home; desperately, one wants one&rsquo;s parents. The night thickens and despair settles in, true despair, as red and blue lights fire around a corner. The shriek booms after their flares &hellip;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>One forgets, having been destroyed, what happens next, save this: next to one&rsquo;s idol, in the backseat of a car, one cries not for the missed path, but for one&rsquo;s sibling&rsquo;s fallenness.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>One gets up. One dresses in one&rsquo;s drab, half-tattered habit, one eats one&rsquo;s bleak breakfast. One packs a spartan lunch, one trudges unwashed out of one&rsquo;s apartment. One&rsquo;s neighborhood is spartan and unwashed, the train one takes southward to the Office is spartan and unwashed. The train descends, rises up from its descent&mdash;the second and greater of one&rsquo;s city&rsquo;s two grand effluvia emerges glistening and churning in the morning light. The train descends once again. One finds a seat, stands back up. One conceives of a Work&mdash;a fantasia of subjectivity&mdash;one destroys the Work. The doors open, one climbs the filthy station steps up into the entropic crush of street life. One makes the short, disorienting walk to the Office.&nbsp;</p>
