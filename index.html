				<p>At last one lifts one&rsquo;s head, and another dream disappears&mdash;where does it go? One reaches back for it in one&rsquo;s mind&mdash;and reactivates a thought, something else entirely, a glittering image. Something quivers inside it, an inertia, a gravity. What here is tickled? What motions have commenced? Something gathers, rises, cusps over the edge, surges &hellip;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>A family vacation. One is young&mdash;ten, eleven, perhaps. This trip, one&rsquo;s parents insist, a milky fondness in their eyes, is a gift, a freedom, a time to be enjoyed. To one, above all it is a time to be with one&rsquo;s eldest sibling, the idol of one&rsquo;s youth, who one looks up to with an unreasoned, unconsidered fervor, who one worships as a way unto themselves&mdash;what one&rsquo;s sibling desires enters the world as one&rsquo;s desires fluidly, as if there were no media nor mind traversed in the transference, as if it belonged to both at the moment of its conception &hellip; the cottage one&rsquo;s family rents is tucked into a sleepy hamlet near a beach whose refined white sand has blown into the turns and gutters and cracks of the streets, paling the hanging, sinewy verdure, abundant but salted-thin, brittle and sand-choked. Copses and leaf-strewn paths branch off every chalky road, decaying tunnels wend through properties whose demarcations the sands and the winds have long ago effaced &hellip; one&rsquo;s family had taken an isolated way that pathed through overgrown groves, gray-green, thick with thistle and lichen and loose-barked sea-birch, and opened onto a pristine, secluded beach. Here, the ocean, graded from the earthy hues, emerged a quiet infinity, eliciting, even then&mdash;for one was young&mdash;grand conceptions of oneself. Here&mdash;and even then&mdash;one howled with the fierce wind of identity, one hummed the quiet lullabies of thought&mdash;and so did one's sibling, first, irrevocably &hellip; one&rsquo;s sibling wishes to take one, one alone, to this beach&mdash;and so it is one&rsquo;s desire as well. One&rsquo;s parents worry, avoid the question. But one&rsquo;s sibling insists. At last, despite themselves, one parent concludes it&rsquo;s safe enough: the kids, they&rsquo;re older now, it&rsquo;s time they, their parents, realized that. The other parent looks on worryingly, knowing something and feeling another, saying nothing &hellip; and so it is allowed. With great fanfare one and one&rsquo;s sibling begin. As the property&rsquo;s threshold is crossed, something changes, something inside changes. Adults now, humans now, one and one&rsquo;s sibling begin to march&mdash;one&rsquo;s sibling knows the way to the path; of course, mature, one's sibling has memorized it, has observed the world, internalized its knowledge&mdash;one knows this. One follows willingly, gladly: alone, on a foreign road, walking with one&rsquo;s idol, conquering the world, becoming alive&mdash;could one ask for more? One doesn&rsquo;t think of what sunlight remains in the day, though it is late: an hour of walking flies by in sheer delight. There is nothing to fear, for one is following one&rsquo;s messiah to a promised land, a new existence &hellip; another hour passes. Night begins to descend. One&rsquo;s sibling, to one&rsquo;s shock, begins to cry. The hamlet is small, there are no road signs, the streets are all similar: another brown-paneled house dilapidating under the steady pressure of sea weather, another white shack greening at the gills&mdash;this at every corner. Paths to the beach suggest themselves&mdash;one copse beckons, another; one&rsquo;s sibling suggests one is near, though one&rsquo;s sibling is weeping. And then the confession&mdash;I do not know where we are anymore &hellip; the myth fractures. Suddenly one knows fear. One&rsquo;s mind leaps into the unknown: one is sure to die, one knows what it means to be alone and die; one loses one&rsquo;s name in the suffocating fear. There is no hope&mdash;for one&rsquo;s sibling cries too, a hopeless wail. An hour of tears &hellip; not a soul passes. The sand whips up and around, settles in the nostrils, hair, teeth &hellip; night now. One and one&rsquo;s sibling must move. One chooses left because one has not chosen anything for hours&mdash;but the path is long foregone. One only wants home; desperately, one wants one&rsquo;s parents. The night thickens and despair settles in, true despair, as red and blue lights fire around a corner. The shriek booms after their flares &hellip;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>One forgets, having been destroyed, what happens next, save this: next to one&rsquo;s idol, in the backseat of a car, one cries not for the missed path, but for one&rsquo;s sibling&rsquo;s fallenness.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>One gets up. One dresses in one&rsquo;s drab, half-tattered habit, one eats one&rsquo;s bleak breakfast. One packs a spartan lunch, one trudges unwashed out of one&rsquo;s apartment. One&rsquo;s neighborhood is spartan and unwashed, the train one takes southward to one's Office is spartan and unwashed. The train descends, rises from its descent&mdash;the second and greater of one&rsquo;s city&rsquo;s two grand effluvia emerges glistening and churning in the morning light. The train descends once again. One finds a seat, stands back up. One conceives of a Work&mdash;a fantasia of subjectivity&mdash;one destroys the Work. The doors open, one climbs the filthy station steps up into the entropic crush of street life. &nbsp;</p>

				<p>The charitable greens of Commonweal Golf Club were straightforward enough, a little fast, cut short and shoddily in a way you&rsquo;d expect for a public golf course. There were extra-thin patches, bald spots, and tough, missed hispid hairs fringing where grasses connected&mdash;the green to the fairway, the evergreen rough&mdash;this all affecting, across all eighteen holes, a harried working-man&rsquo;s face. Commonweal planners, in the interest of charity, had decided to unload leveling mounds of soil throughout the course, and so the green&rsquo;s dulled contours curved balls toward holes and uncut hairs were merely small deterrents, noisome hiccups expected and accepted by all parties in the ball&rsquo;s inevitable slide to the cup. And too, inevitably, this late April, New England shuffled off its wintry coil with a stiff stretch, flora ejaculated their seed in mindless excitement, the sun stayed high and bright far longer than anyone remembered, and men picked up irons and woods and breathed in the cram of life, the saccharine aroma of unfurling fecundity. These men shanked hard and right, smashing into the mood, and when they finally arrived, after much smashing and breathing and cramming, on the greens, to them emitting greenest green, their Gatsby green, the great American go-light, the whole profound mantle of the fertile months ahead became focused singularly in the feel of a putter in hand, the pendulum stroke, the click, the roll, and the plasticky gargle of the ball circling its way to a make.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Spring had begun.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p> Spring had begun&mdash;Clay&rsquo;s mind went no further. The rest of the golf-spring-complex remained unexplored, out of contact in his mind like a desktop icon single-clicked, a soap-opera star on mute. He did not find or fit words or thoughts to those half-lit-lips&rsquo; mysterious spasms and twitches&mdash;he declared what others had declared to him in such pollened air, subliminal pressures swings, this jovial April crispness. &ldquo;I love Spring,&rdquo; he said, and looked down at the pebbled white ball, streaked with lustrous silver stripes, coated with a soily brown-yellowing, in his hand.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ira, putt the damn ball,&rdquo; Stephen said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Clay had been given the ball by Stephen, he remembered, wondering at the streaks, with the bottom curve of its painted-on black swish already smudged&mdash;as if with a thumb&mdash;and already scratched with little streaks&mdash;like paper cuts&mdash;but it only mattered if he had stroked as Ira had taught him, exactly as he said to&mdash;straight-on face, back-swing-to-swing straight, straight locked left arm&mdash;which is all that mattered in golf, Ira had said&mdash;golf was a game of followed instructions, he&rsquo;d said on the drive over&mdash;but still, it could have been Stephen that had streaked the ball&mdash;but that hardly mattered, that&rsquo;s what Stephen had said when Clay had asked earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> &ldquo;I celebrate myself, and sing myself,&rdquo; Ira said, across the green from Clay and Stephen, lying down on the sloped knoll of rough surrounding the pin. He flung up a bunch of pulled-up grass blades with a flick. In the light-flurrying winds, the emerald blades fell onto his cheeks and fluttered off.&nbsp;</p>

				<p>A long pause, during which no one spoke, the TV was off, and only half of them, those with unlimited data plans, looked at their phones because they hadn&rsquo;t paid their cable bill. Marc, who was sitting next to Andrew, one of the guys on the phone, on a love seat, a curb-pick-up, said, looking up into the dirty-webby corner of the ceiling, &ldquo;There are only two types of people in this world, if you think about it.&rdquo; He followed a crack from the corner down the plaster wall to the trim of sealant separating the wall from the floor, nodding as he followed. &ldquo;Those who expand and those who reduce.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;Expanders and reducers,&rdquo; said Jonathan, <em>feeling</em> the lofty gist of the statement. He was blonde, buzzcutted, tall and lanky, sitting in a lazy boy, his legs and arms seemingly all over yet covering none of the brown leather, and he was stoned. He repeated: &ldquo;Expanders and reducers. Those who expand. Those who reduce.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not 100% on this thought,&rdquo; said Lucas, stretched supine on the couch, his head propped up by the couch&rsquo;s armrest, playing Candy Crush on his phone. &ldquo;This thought isn&rsquo;t clear to me.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;Expanders,&rdquo; Marc said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Reducers. You know?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&ldquo;Did you get high?&rdquo; Jonathan said.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t affect me,&rdquo; Lucas said. &ldquo;This is like the fifth time, and I&rsquo;ve never felt it.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not letting it happen,&rdquo; Andrew said, who alone had received, tacitly, sometime during the four boys&rsquo; time as roommates, the permission to speak to Lucas like this. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re being too rational about it. You can&rsquo;t think about feeling the feeling of being high. Because then you&rsquo;re not feeling <em>it. </em>You&rsquo;re feeling your mind&rsquo;s thinking about feeling. You&rsquo;re not letting <em>it </em>do what <em>it </em>does.&rdquo; </p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Andrew was not high.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Lucas said, not bothering to follow this line of thinking, regarding it mostly tautology or irony or the transitive property or whatever.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> Another pause.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;Dude,&rdquo; Jonathan said. He sat up, held out his hands as if to declaim something. &ldquo;Dude. God is the ultimate reducer. Not the other way around, which is what they want you to think.&rdquo; He moved his hands in a vague encapsulating gesture, what amounted to an incomplete circle. &ldquo;He built the world in seven days? That&rsquo;s reduction. The world is way too complicated for that. I mean, think about it, have you read Genesis?&rdquo; He looked at Marc, who was half-listening, who, having already decided this was off-base, was predominantly focusing on the way the zipper on Lucas&rsquo;s shorts bulged outward, wondering whether this was a true reflection of his penis size, whether girls thought about boys in this manner, whether he was <em>ipso facto</em> gay for thinking this thought about Lucas&rsquo;s penis size, though he had not envisioned his actual penis yet, until just now, the wrinkly thing. &ldquo;The whole thing is written in, like, really reduced sentences,&rdquo; Jonathan continued. &ldquo;God made this and there was that thing. Okay: but what about science? So God made the sun, but did he make a billion hydrogen atoms? Strong nuclear force. He created the <em>idea </em>of the sun, if he created anything, you know?&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;Stupid,&rdquo; Lucas said.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s reductive,&rdquo; Andrew said. Andrew was Asian, Chinese specifically. &ldquo;And you just reduced what Jonathan reduced about God, who reduced everything primarily, first.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;Into stories,&rdquo; Marc said, counting the cracks in the wood floor, dividing them by the number of dust-browned gum-mounds.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;God didn&rsquo;t <em>write </em>the stories,&rdquo; said Lucas, feeling good about making this very clear point to Marc. &ldquo;Other people reduced God into stories.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;God himself is not the reducer,&rdquo; Jonathan said as if reading it from scripture, with the pitch of revelation. &ldquo;We reduce him.&rdquo; He made the encapsulating motion again. &ldquo;Humans, language: we reduce the spirit of God by ascribing words to him. Capital H. His almightiness overcomes the rational limitations of man&rsquo;s meaning-constructs, language. We have caged God in a prison of words. His spirit overcomes.&rdquo;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;<em>Aufhebung</em>,&rdquo; Marc whispered, after the overt holiness of Jonathan&rsquo;s thought and the discovery that the exact ratio of floor-cracks to gum-mounds in this vicinity was 6:1, his birthday, reacted, like in the chemical sense, forming a molecular glimmer of supreme and interstellar comprehension that every person&rsquo;s existence was assigned, at their birth, a set of numbers, a <em>ratio</em>, <em>objectivity</em>, which, if identified, could describe with flawless precision all relationships, movements, the very way <em>change </em>appears to a person, the very way self and other, that primordial, <em>difference, </em>manifested in, <em>itself actualized</em> the primordial and individuating constructs of subjective mind.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;What?&rdquo; Lucas said.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p> &ldquo;<em>Aufhebung</em> ,&rdquo; Marc said. The glow of understanding dimmed. He coughed. &ldquo;Aufbung. Sublation. I don&rsquo;t know. Hegel. Transcendentalism. Numbers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
